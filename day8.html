In daisy wheel printer, round disk extends a portion of the wheel making contact with ink ribbon that makes contact with paper for creating the character. This procedure is repeated for each key when it is pressed. These printers are fitted with unchangeable print heads called daisy wheels. To print each character, the wheel is rotated and the appropriate stoke struck against an inked ribbon. Daisy wheel printers cannot produce high quality print graphics. The speed of this printer is about 100 CPS.</p>

            <p align="justify">Computer software, on the other hand, is not something you can touch. Software is a set of instructions for a computer to perform specific operations. You need both hardware and software for a computer system to work.</p>
        <h3>Types of Software</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>System Software</li>
                <li>Application Software</li>

        <h3>System Software</h3><hr width="150px" align="left">
        <p>The software that helps us to use the computer system to perform very basic task is called system software.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Opreating Systems</li>
            <li>Language Translator</li>
            <li>Device Driver Software</li>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <li><h4>Opreating Software</h4>
                <p align="justify">An operating system is the most important system software and is a must to operate a computer system . it manages a computer’s resources very efficiently , takes care of scheduling multiple jobs for execution and manages the flow of data and instruction between the input/output units and the main memory. It provides an environment for the execution of programs . it acts as an interface between user and computer’s hardware , e.g. DOS, UNIX, LINUX, Windows, Mac  OS.

            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Language Translator</h4>
                <p>A Language translator is system software which translates a computer program written by a user into a machine understandable form .</p>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>Compiler</li>
                    <li>Interpreter</li>
                    <li>Assembler</li>
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li><h4>Compiler</h4></li>
                            <p align="justify">A compiler is a translator used to convert high-level programming language to low-level programming language.  It converts the whole program in one session and reports errors detected after the conversion.  Compiler takes time to do its work as it translates high-level code to lower-level code all at once and then saves it to memory. A compiler is processor-dependent and platform-dependent. <br> <b>Example:- Microsoft Visual Studio</b></p>
                    </ol>
                    <ol type="i" start="2">
                    <li><h4>Interpreter</h4></li> 
                        <p align="justify">Just like a compiler, is a translator used to convert high-level programming language to low-level programming language.  It converts the program one at a time and reports errors detected at once, while doing the conversion.  With this, it is easier to detect errors than in a compiler.  An interpreter is faster than a compiler as it immediately executes the code upon reading the code.It is often used as a debugging tool for software development as it can execute a single line of code at a time.  An interpreter is also more portable than a compiler as it is not processor-dependent <b>Example:- Python</b></p>
                    </ol>    
                    <ol type="i" start="3">
                    <li><h4>Assembler</h4></li> 
                        <p align="justify">An assembler is a translator used to translate assembly language to machine language. Assembly language is difficult to understand as it is a low-level programming language.  An assembler translates a low-level language, an assembly language to an even lower-level language, which is the machine code.  The machine code can be directly understood by the CPU. <br> <b>Example:- Fortran Assembly Program (FAP)</b> </p>
                    </ol>
                </ol>
            </li>
        <li>
            <h4> Device Driver Software</h4>
            <p align="justify">More commonly known as a driver, a device driver or hardware driver is a group of files that enable one or more hardware devices to communicate with the computer's operating system. Without drivers, the computer would not be able to send and receive data correctly to hardware devices, such as a printer.

        <h3>Application Software</h3><hr>
        <p>Application software is written to   solve a specific task. These are of two types.</p>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>General purpose Application software</li>
                <li>Specific Application Software</li>
                <li>Utility Software </li>
            </ol>
        <ol type="i">
            <li><h4>General purpose Application software</h4></li>
            <p>Software that is written to perform generalized data processing task is known as used by many people in general purpose application. <br> <b>Example:- MS_WORD ., MS – EXCEL , MS – POWERPOINT etc.</b> 
            </p>
        </ol>
        <ol type="i" start="2">
            <li><h4>Specific Application Software</h4></li>
            <p align="justify">This Software are customized and written according to the specific needs of a user, e.g. Billing software of a departmental store. Database management software of a school. Inventor management software of a warehouse etc.</p>
        </ol>
        <ol type="i" start="3">
           <li><h4>Utility Software</h4></li> 
            <p align="justify">Application software that assists system software in doing their work is called utility software. Thus, utility software is actually a cross between system software and application software. Examples, Antivirus software. Thus utility software is actually a cross between system software and application software Examples, Antivirus software Disk management tools. File management tools. Compression tools, Backup tools etc.</p>
